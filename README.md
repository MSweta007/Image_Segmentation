# Image_Segmentation
This is a project which deals with U-Net model. The data input here is Phantom 4 RTK RGB data over NITK Search site. This same code can also be used for Multispectral data as well, changing the no. of channels. Well it can also be used for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data as well! The accuracy found is above 90. This can only be achieved once proper amount of training data is given. Also just in 30 epochs it has already started giving the desired result, running the model for more than the required cycle might overfit the data. For my data these are the no. of epochs and accuracy. This might be different if input data is changed.
